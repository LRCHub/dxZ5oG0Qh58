We don’t talk about Bruno,
no, no, no
We don’t talk about Bruno, but
It was my wedding day
(it was our wedding day)
We were getting ready
And there wasn’t a cloud
in the sky
(no clouds allowed in the sky)
Bruno walks in with a
mischievous grin
(thunder)
You telling this story or am I?
(I’m sorry, mi vida, go on)
Bruno says,
“It looks like rain”
(why did he tell us?)
In doing so, he floods my brain
(Abuela, get the umbrellas)
Married in a hurricane
(what a joyous day, but anyway)
We don’t talk about Bruno,
no, no, no
We don’t talk about Bruno
Hey, grew to live in fear of
Bruno stuttering or stumbling
I can always hear him sort of
muttering and mumbling
I associate him with the
sound of falling sand
(tss, tss, tss)
It’s a heavy lift with a gift
so humbling
Always left Abuela and
the family fumbling
Grappling with prophecies
they couldn’t understand
Do you understand?
A seven-foot frame,
rats along his back
When he calls your name
it all fades to black
Yeah, he sees your dreams
and feasts on your screams
(hey)
We don’t talk about Bruno,
no, no, no
(no no)
We don’t talk about Bruno
(we don’t talk about Bruno)
He told me my fish would die,
the next day, dead
(no, no)
He told me I’d grow a gut
and just like he said
(no, no)
He said that all my hair
would disappear,
now, look at my head
(no, no)
Your fate is sealed
when your prophecy is read
He told me that
the life of my dreams
Would be promised
and someday be mine
He told me that
my power would grow
Like the grapes that
thrive on the vine
(oye, Mariano’s on his way)
He told me that
the man of my dreams
Would be just out of reach,
betrothed to another
It’s like I hear him now
(hey, sis)
I want not a sound out of you
(it’s like I can hear him now)
I can hear him now
Um, Bruno
Yeah, about that Bruno
I really need to know
about Bruno
Give me the truth and
the whole truth, Bruno
(Isabela,
your boyfriend’s here)
Time for dinner
A seven-foot frame
(it was my wedding day)
Rats along his back
(it was our wedding day)
(we were getting ready)
When he calls your name,
it all fades to black
(and there wasn’t a cloud
in the sky)
(No clouds allowed in the sky)
Yeah, he sees your dreams and
feasts on your screams
(Bruno walks in with a
mischievous grin)
You telling this story or am I?
Oye, Mariano’s on his way
Bruno says,
“It looks like rain”
(a seven-foot frame,
rats along his back)
In doing so,
he floods my brain
(when he calls your name,
it all fades to black)
Married in a hurricane
(yeah, he sees your dreams and
feasts on your screams)
He’s here
Don’t talk about Bruno
Why did I talk about Bruno?
Not a word about Bruno
I never should’ve
brought up Bruno
